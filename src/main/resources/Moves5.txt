Detect	Almost always goes first. The user is protected from all attacks for one turn, but the move's success rate halves with each consecutive use of Protect, Detect or Endure. If a Pokemon has No Guard, or used Lock-On or Mind Reader against the user during the previous turn, its attack has a [100 - move's normal accuracy]% chance to hit through Detect; OHKO moves do not benefit from this effect.

Doom Desire	This move, even if the user and/or the target switch out, will strike the active target at the end of the second turn after its use. This move cannot cause a critical hit and its damage is calculated by using the original user's Special Attack and the original target's Special Defense. The move's damage is typeless so it never receives STAB and ignores weaknesses, resistances and immunities against this move's type. Only one instance of Doom Desire or Future Sight may be active at a time; because Doom Desire is typeless and occurs at the end of the round, it also hits through Protect, Detect, Endure and Wonder Guard.	Special Damage	Steel	5	120	85%

The move's damage is typeless so it never receives STAB and ignores weaknesses, resistances and immunities against this move's type. Only one instance of Future Sight or Doom Desire may be active at a time; because Future Sight is typeless and occurs at the end of the round, it also hits through Protect, Detect, Endure and Wonder Guard.

Substitute	The user takes one-fourth of its maximum HP to create a substitute; this move fails if the user does not have enough HP for this.

The user is still affected by Tickle, Hail, Sandstorm and Attract from behind its Substitute. If a Substitute breaks from a hit during a multistrike move such as Fury Attack, the user takes damage from the remaining strikes.	Other Damage	Normal	10	N/A	N/A

Toxic Spikes	Opponents will be poisoned as they enter the field until they use Rapid Spin. One layer inflicts regular poison while two layers inflict Toxic; switching in a non-Flying-type Poison Pokemon without Levitate will remove any layers.

Trick Room	Always goes last. Attacking order is reversed for all active Pokemon for five turns; the slowest Pokemon moves first and vice versa. Note that move order is still determined by the regular priority categories and the effects of Trick Room apply only when Pokemon have chosen moves with the same priority. Using Trick Room a second time reverses this effect. This effect is also ignored by Stall and held items that may affect the turn order: Full Incense, Lagging Tail, Quick Claw and Custap Berry.	Other Damage	Psychic	5	N/A	N/A

If the replacement Pokemon knows this move and is holding Choice Band, Choice Specs or Choice Scarf, it will be locked into the move, though Pokemon holding those items who don't know the move can select their attack as normal. When a faster Pokemon uses Pursuit against a Pokemon who uses this move, the latter is hit for normal damage; when a slower Pokemon uses Pursuit against a move who uses this move, the latter makes its attack, then is hit by Pursuit for double power, and switches out.
